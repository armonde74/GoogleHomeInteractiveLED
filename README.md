# GoogleHomeInteractiveLED
This is a simple project combining the code of Greg Gensom's Interactive LEDs
Which is Available at https://github.com/Grensom/LED-Audio-Spectrum/blob/master/Led_audio.ino
and the code created by Nick's Electronic youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufVbt8gSevE

It enables Google Assistant voice control for preset LED color presentations as well as a mode for music interactivity with a connected
sound detector.
